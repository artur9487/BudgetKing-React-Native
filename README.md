# Current development:
A React Native App on android. The concept of this app is a transactions register, where according to this data it can present different analytics. It has an option to authenticate the user and the ability to display payments flow during a specific time period on line charts. The app can also prepare statements of every category based of the specific payments and displaying them using pie charts. It is also possible to visualize and compare payments in selected time period. The various data fragments are transferred to Firebase Cloud Database and received through redux thunk middleware. 

# Planned development: 
Except of the option of manual typing the products and incomes the app will have an option to serialize various characters from shopping bills throught Expo OCR and according to this, it will automatically register and make analytic statements. The future plans about this app consist also of making financial forecasts from a specific budget what the user currently owns and to suggest the best aproaches to save money.
